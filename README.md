This repository demonstrates the usage of the `geotargets` package. It was initially created to demonstrate some of the issues around using geospatial data with targets, and it led to the creation of the `geotargets` package. 

To see implementations of common geospatial operations, see the [_targets.R](_targets.R) file.
